<p>
I start this lab by creating a ticket and signing in as a agent to work the ticket,in this case
  i used Chase as the first agent. 
</p>
<br />

</p>
<p>I opened the ticket and started setting it up.
<ul>
  <li>priority emergency</li>
  <li>department= corp. admin</li>
  <li>assign ticket to chase{myself in this case}</li>
  <li>SLA plan= choose SEV-A</li>
</ul>

<br />

</p>
<p>
After setting up the ticket i started working on it talked to the client
  <p>as if it were in real life working as a desk help agent is always advice to talk to</p>
  <p>the client in the phone before even setting up the ticket and investigate the problem</p>
  <p>because may be is more severe than you thought and have to reclassify or vice versa.</p>
  <p>Also treating the costumer the right way and always updating them once in a while is crucial</p>
  <p> so they know what the situation is. </p>

<P>After all that set up i started working the ticket as i said is always best to talk in the phone</P>
<p>to have a better understanding of the proble, and be able to make a corect assesment of the problem.</p>

<p>Set Properties to all the tickets; do SEV-A (SysAdmins last), observe ticket becomes inaccessible
Switch to admin panel and assign yourself View-access to Sys Admins
Switch to agent panel and observe the escalated ticket
Observe that you can no longer make changes to it
</p>
<p>Solve all of the tickets
Explain in most ticketing systems (probably this one too) there is an email capability so every time you update the ticket, the user gets a copy and they can respond
</p>
<p>Explain ticket intake IRL:
Sometimes tickets get created via phone, chat app, email, web form, or maybe even you run into someone in your hall or they roll up on you at your desk.
A lot of the time people will randomize you and try to get you to fix stuff on the spot. It’s fine to fix things on the spot, but generally speaking, you want to create tickets for EVERYTHING you do. (metrics are important)
</p>
<p>Finishing up and additional practice
Obviously there is much more to this product that covered here
Encourage the use and exploration of the email feature
Do this lab a few more times, enough times where you’re able to implement it with this simple checklist. This will build your intuition.
Talk about Technical skill pillar
Re-touch on technical ability and re-doing the lab several
